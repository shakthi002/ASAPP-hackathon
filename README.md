This project aims to process research papers (PDF files) by extracting text and images from the PDF, summarizing them, and embedding the summaries into a vector database for efficient retrieval. It uses state-of-the-art models like Cohere and Groq for text embedding and image summarization, and provides an easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.
